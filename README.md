## 🛒 Amazon Clone - JS Fundamentals Project

A complete Amazon-style shopping experience built from scratch using core JavaScript concepts, 
without frameworks. This project demonstrates how front-end logic, structure, and behavior come 
together in a real-world application.

## 💻 Tech Stack 

This project is a hands-on implementation of essential JavaScript concepts It covers:

**Core Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, functions, booleans, math, and strings.
**Data Structures:** Arrays and objects used for product and cart management.
**DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically renders products, handles cart actions, and updates the UI.

**Advanced JS:** Modular structure, reusable functions, callback patterns, and external libraries (dayjs).
**OOP Principles:** Classes and inheritance for cart and product logic.
**Asynchronous JavaScript:** Applied Promises and async/await in feature simulations.
**Version Control & Deployment:** Managed via Git and hosted using GitHub Pages.

## 📚 How It Helps

- Understand the **flow of data** across files and UI
- Apply core JavaScript concepts in real-world applications
- Structure projects in a **modular and scalable** way
- Prepare for interviews or internships by demonstrating hands-on skills
